    <h2>Przygotowanie :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.         </li>
        <li>  In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.  </li>
        <li>  Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.  </li>
        <li>    In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.</li>
        <li>Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.</li>
        <li>Optional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.</li>
        <li>Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 180°C oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.</li>
